## Unit2 Objected Oriented Programming
- original computers couldn't understand modern programming language
    - used machine language, not meant for humans to understand, meant to tell computer what to do
- programming languages are made for humans
- first programming language was assembly language, example below

  - example code breakdown: d=255; for(int i =0; i<d; i++){d--;}

- assembler takes assembly language and converts it to machine language
 
Ex:

- expression from assembly language corresponds to a symbol in machine language, easy conversion
- assembly language referred to as low level programming language, because close to computer
- people wanted languages further away from computer, deals with ideas humans more familiar with 
- Fortran example:

  - self explanatory code
        
- programming language designed with a purpose
    - general purpose language used to solve wide variety of problems
    - other program languages designed to solve specific problems
- Fortran originally designed to help people in math and science
    - commonly used by astronomers
- COBOL used for data processing, Ex:

  - used in business, specific purpose
- many languages because many ways to solve a problem
  - another reason is that people seek to improve programming languages
    - ex: java, came from c++
- object oriented programming
  - like using a cellphone
    - don't know how cellphone works, but know how to use cellphone
    - don't need to know how it works
  - like using a microwave
    - don't know specifics of microwave
    - just know how to use it
- programmers realized we live object oriented
  - don't know the specifics, but know how to use stuff
- objected oriented programming requires classes to create objects
- java example with cellphone:

  - just need to pass in required data to object in order to use
- object oriented programming useful in collaboration
  - allows concurrent development

## Unit1 Primitive Data Types in Java

[![Click to Watch](https://img.youtube.com/vi/W0q7XkV7BTo/0.jpg)](https://apclassroom.collegeboard.org/8/assignments?apd=4bsjoi2rui&status=assigned&unit=-2)

- In Java, there are 8 primitive data types
- First will focus on the difference between doubles and integers

- Trying to store the values added together in sum as an int would result in an error because data can be lost in that calculation.
- Take in information, manipulate it, and output new information (point of code)

- Strings are NOT primitive data types
