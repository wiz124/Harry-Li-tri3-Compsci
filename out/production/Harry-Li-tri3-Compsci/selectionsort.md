# Selection Sorting Algorithms analysis:
### Terms to know:
  - time complexity 
      - amount of computer time it takes to run the algorithm
  - space complexity
      - amount of memory required by the algorithm until complete execution
## Selection Sort:
How it works:
  - loops through nth element to last element of array
  - always begins with n=0 and n increments by 1 each time elements are traversed
  - each time we traverse array, we find smallest element and swap it with nth position element
``` java
for (int i = 0; i < array.size()-1; i++) {

            // find smallest num between (i + 1) element and last element
            int position = i;
            for (int j = i; j < array.size(); j++) {
                if (array.get(j) < array.get(position))
                    position = j;
                compare++;
            }

            // Swap smallest number to current array position
            int min = array.get(position);
            array.set(position, array.get(i));
            array.set(i, min);
            swap++;
        }
```
### Big O complexity:
  - case time complexity
      - Worst case, best case, and average case: O(N^2)
      - the number of comparisons are constant for each case due to the nature of the double for loops
      - given this, selection sort more inefficient as data set becomes bigger 
  - space complexity 
      - O(1): algorithm just needs to keep track of elements for swapping and smallest element in unsorted array
      - requires very little memory
