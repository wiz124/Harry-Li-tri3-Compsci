# Merge Sorting Algorithms analysis:
### Terms to know:
  - time complexity 
      - amount of computer time it takes to run the algorithm
  - space complexity
      - amount of memory required by the algorithm until complete execution
## Merge Sort:
How it works:
  - splits array into pieces of 2
  - these pieces are then sorted
  - then pieces are merged and sorted until all data merged and sorted
  - basically a case of divide and conquer
  
``` java
//method begin
divide(0,array.size()-1);
//method end


public void divide(int start, int end) {
        if (start < end && (end - start) >= 1) {
            int mid = (end + start) / 2;
            //recursion
            divide(start, mid);
            divide(mid + 1,end );
            merger(start, mid, end);
        }
    }
    public void merger(int start, int mid, int end){

        //arraylist that will be the new sorted array
        ArrayList<Integer> mergedSortedArray = new ArrayList<>();

        int leftIndex = start;
        int rightIndex = mid+1;

        while(leftIndex<=mid && rightIndex<=end){
            if(input.get(leftIndex)<=input.get(rightIndex)){
                mergedSortedArray.add(input.get(leftIndex));
                leftIndex++;
            }else{
                mergedSortedArray.add(input.get(rightIndex));
                rightIndex++;
            }
            compare++;
        }

        //Either of below while loop will execute
        while(leftIndex<=mid){
            mergedSortedArray.add(input.get(leftIndex));
            leftIndex++;
        }

        while(rightIndex<=end){
            mergedSortedArray.add(input.get(rightIndex));
            rightIndex++;
        }

        int i = 0;
        int j = start;


        while(i<mergedSortedArray.size()){
            input.set(j, mergedSortedArray.get(i++));
            j++;
        }

    }
```
### Big O complexity:
  - case time complexity 
      - best case, worst case, and average case: O(n*log(n))
      - ability to divide work makes it very fast
  - space complexity
      - O(n), amount of subarrays increases as data set increases
      - larger datasets requires more memory
     
### Analytics:
No swaps in merge sort needed

Around 55 thousand comparisons done

total time taken for the 12 tests is .09 seconds

average time taken for each test is .0076 seconds

shortest time taken was .00299 seconds

longest time taken was .0259 seconds
