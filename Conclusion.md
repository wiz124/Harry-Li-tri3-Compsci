# Data Tables

| Sort | swaps(per case) |comparisons(per case) | total time of all 12 tests | avg time | highest time | lowest time | 
| ---- | --------------- | -------------------- | -------------------------- | -------- | ------------ | ----------- |
| Bubble | 6.1 to 6.3 million | 12497500 | 1.67 seconds | .14 seconds | .236 seconds | .124 seconds | 
| Selection | 4999 | 12502499 | .422 seconds | .0352 seconds | .0618 seconds | .0279 seconds |
| Insertion | 6.1 to 6.3 million | 12.5 to 12.6 million | .385 seconds | .0321 seconds | .0638 seconds | .0269 seconds|
| Merge | 0 | 55000 |.09 seconds | .0076 seconds | .0259 seconds | .00299 seconds |

# Conclusion of Sorting ALgorithms
The three sorts except merge all have little memory requirements however are slower than merge

Merge sort is the fastest however it requires the most memory as dataset becomes bigger, this is further enforced by its time and space complexity  

Bubblesort is the slowest, followed by selection then insertion

Bubble, insertion, and selection time complexity make them inefficient at larger data sets

### My opinion: 
I would select merge sort for faster speed times as long as memory is not important

If memory was important than I would select insertion sort for its faster times and low memory requirements
