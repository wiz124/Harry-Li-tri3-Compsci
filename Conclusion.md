# Conclusion of Sorting ALgorithms
The three sorts except merge all have little memory requirements however are slower than merge

Merge sort is the fastest however it requires the most memory as dataset becomes bigger, this is further enforced by its time and space complexity  

Bubblesort is the slowest, followed by selection then insertion

Bubble, insertion, and selection time complexity make them inefficient at larger data sets

### My opinion: 
I would select merge sort for faster speed times as long as memory is not important

If memory was important than I would select insertion sort for its faster times and low memory requirements
